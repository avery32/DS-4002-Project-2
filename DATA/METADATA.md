**Data Summary:**  
This data set contains marriage rates by month from 2000-2009. The data has both number of marriages each month and then the rate of marriages per 1000 people in the population  
**Provenance:**  
This data comes from 5 vital national statistics reports created by the CDC.  These annual reports cover statistics on deaths, marriage rates, birth rates and divorce rates. These vital statistical reports are collected by individual states and then put together for the final national reports. For our purposes, we used the annual reports for each year which showed a monthly breakdown of these statistics. Given that these reports often only showed the data for the current year and the year before, we merged them into one csv file to have all annual data from 2000-2009.

**Ethical Statements:**  
An uncertainty we want to acknowledge is the rounding of these numbers. All marriage numbers for a month are rounded to the nearest thousand, it was unclear to us how that was rounded, so we wanted to highlight that. The most important column we will be looking at is the marriage rate column. This gives a standardized indicator of marriage regardless of population, given that it provides the rate of marriages per 1000 in the population. One thing we must note, however, is that while this data was being collected, debates over same-sex marriage were happening throughout the US. While a couple of states were beginning to legalize same-sex marriage, most states did not at the time that this data was collected. As a result these numbers will not reflect a majority of same-sex couples.
